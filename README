# cs3113fa21-project1
Andrew McGuffin
Program is run by reading inputs in through stdin. 
Throughput function seems a little finicky and needs improvement.

Assumptions:
-number of processes is just 1
-number of threads is under 32

Program has several unused modules in anticipation for upcoming projects, notably execution_element_t.

Functions include linked list creation functions and functions for finding the various project requirements. Comments in the code describe their states and operations at various points.

Library statements: #include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
#include<stdlib.h>
#include<stdbool.h>
#include<stdint.h>
#include <assert.h>
